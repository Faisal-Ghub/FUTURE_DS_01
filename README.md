Tools & Technologies Used 🛠️

• Power BI Desktop: Dashboard development, data modeling, and visualization

• Excel: Data source preparation and cleaning

• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Calculated metrics like profit margin, AOV, and repeat customer rate

• Power BI Features Used ⚡

• Cards & KPIs for key metrics

• Line, bar, and column charts for trend analysis

• Slicers for dynamic filtering by year, category, region, and segment

• Interactive dashboard elements (tooltips, drill-throughs)

Files Included 📁

📄 Sales_Data.xlsx – Raw dataset provided by the internship team

📊 Sales_Dashboard.pbix – Power BI dashboard file

Key Insights (Summary) 💡

• Sales, profit, and AOV show a steady increase from 2012 to 2014

• Repeat customer rate fluctuates, dipping in 2013 but recovering in 2014

• Profit margin jumps in 2014, indicating improved efficiency or higher-margin sales

• Technology category is declining, Office Supplies are growing, and Furniture is volatile

• California and New York dominate sales, highlighting regional concentration

• Top 5 products consistently contribute the most revenue

• Both B2B (Corporate, Home Office) and Consumer segments show strong repeat behavior

How to Explore the Dashboard 🧭

• Open Sales_Dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop

• Use slicers to filter data by year, region, category, or segment
